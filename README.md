# CS440_CH04_Demo_Bartlett_Chris
THIS IS A SCHOOL PROJECT WITH NO CODE
I chose a MIT license for this github repository because I thought it the simplest of the licenses. 
All I wanted was a license that would let anyone do what they want with this repo so you could see 
and grade and take this readme. And also I am not liable for anything that anyone does with this 
repo, I don't want anything strange coming back to haunt me.
